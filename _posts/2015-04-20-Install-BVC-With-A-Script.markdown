This video walks you through installing the Brocade Vyatta Controller via an installation script.  The video shows version 1.2.0, but the script is updated to match the latest version of Brocade Vyatta Controller, which is currently 1.3.0.  The process is the same except that the BVC .zip files you will download will have 1.3.0 in their name instead of 1.2.0.
